\section{9/5 (David Nadler) -- Introduction}

Our goal is to discuss Rozansky-Witten theory.
Some related topics include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Quasicoherent sheaves of categories (as discussed last spring).
	\item Categories of matrix factorizations.\footnote{In more detail: given a smooth variety $X$ and a function $f: X \to \AA^1$, we can construct a category $\MF_f$ which categorifies the vanishing cycles of $f$.}
	\item The cobordism hypothesis.
	\item Local structure theory of holomorphic symplectic varieties.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What is Rozansky-Witten theory?}

Suppose we have a hyperk\"ahler / holomorphic symplectic manifold $X$.
This means that $X$ has a holomorphic $(2, 0)$-form $\omega$ satisfying the (complex analogues of) the usual symplectic form axioms.
Given such an $X$, there is a conjectural 3-dimensional topological field theory $\Zc_X$, called \emph{Rozansky-Witten theory} with target $X$.

What we mean by 3d TFT is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Given a closed 3-manifold\footnote{Typically with some extra structure, e.g.\ an orientation} $M^3$, we obtain a number $\Zc_X(M^3)$.
	\item Closed 2-manifolds $M^2$ give vector spaces $\Zc_X(M^2)$.
	\item Closed 1-manifolds $M^1$ give categories\footnote{As is standard for GRT, we use the implicit $\infty$ convention.} $\Zc_X(M^1)$.
	\item Closed 0-manifolds $M^0$ give 2-categories $\Zc_X(M^0)$.
\end{itemize}
In particular, $\Zc_X(\pt)$ is a 2-category.
The \emph{cobordism hypothesis} tells us that we can recover the entire theory $\Zc_X$ from the ``3-dualizable'' 2-category $\Zc_X(\pt)$.
For purposes of geometric representation theory, we are most interested in the low-dimensional behavior, which captures more data about the theory.

Rozansky-Witten theory should satisfy something like:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $Z_X(S^2) = \Oc(X)$.\footnote{By our conventions, this is what is classically called $\Rbf \Gamma(X, \Oc)$, so there is interesting derived information.}
	\item $Z_X(S^1) = \Coh(X)$.
\end{itemize}
These end up inheriting interesting structure from the TFT.

\subsection{Why do we care?}

Recall that 2-dimensional mirror symmetry can be schematically understood as an equivalence between the following 2d TFTs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item An A-model $\Ac$ arising from symplectic geometry
	\item A B-model $\Bc_X$, coming from some K\"ahler manifold $X$, satisfying $\Bc_X(\pt) \simeq \Coh(X)$.
\end{itemize}
In particular, $\Ac(\pt)$ is often some category of geometric interest, and the equivalence $\Ac(\pt) \simeq \Bc_X(\pt)$ lets us resolve questions about $\Ac(\pt)$.

There's an analogue in higher dimensions: we'd like to take a 3d TFT $\Yc$ and give an equivalence $\Yc \simeq \Zc_X$ for some holomorphic symplectic $X$.
This would give an equivalence between some 2-category and $\Zc_X(\pt)$.

\begin{conj}[Teleman]
	Let $G$ be a complex reductive group with maximal compact subgroup $G_c$.
	There is an equivalence between:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A suitable 2-category of ``categories with $G_c$-action.''
		\item The Rozansky-Witten 2-category of $T^*(G^\vee / G^\vee)$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{conj}

Note that $T^*(G^\vee / G^\vee)$ is stacky and non-proper, which makes it impossible for the corresponding 2-category to be 3-dualizable.
Thus we typically won't obtain 3-manifold invariants from such a theory.
That's terrible for 3-manifold topologists, but this isn't a 3-manifold seminar.

Some other examples of interest for Rozansky-Witten theory include symplectic resolutions and cotangent bundles of smooth algebraic varieties.

\subsection{What is the correct 2-category?}

To rigorously construct Rozansky-Witten theory, we'd need to give a definition of the 2-category $\RW_2 = \Zc_X(\pt)$.
This was studied by Kapustin, Rozansky, and Saulina, but much is still unknown.

Roughly, we expect $\RW_2$ to be a 2-category where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Objects are smooth Lagrangians $L \subset X$ (or some suitable generalization of these).
	\item 1-morphisms from $L_1$ to $L_2$ are given by some sort of category associated to $L_1 \cap L_2$.
		In the simplest possible case, where $X = T^* W$ is a cotangent bundle, $L_1$ is the zero-section, and $L_2$ is the graph of a differential $df$, then $L_1 \cap L_2$ is the critical locus of $X$ and we assign $\Hom(L_1, L_2) = \MF_f$, the matrix factorization category of $f$.
		Work of Joyce and many others has focused on understanding how much the local setting looks like this.
	\item 2-morphisms and higher are ``natural compatibilities'' between the 1-morphisms.
\end{itemize}

One should think of the matrix factorization category $\MF_f$ as giving a categorical way to measure the critical locus of $f$.
When the critical points of $f$ are Morse, the category $\MF_f$ looks like a direct sum of copies of $\Vect$ (one for each critical point).

There is an important distinction between Rozansky-Witten theory and the 2d A-model.
In the complex setting, there are no ``instantons,'' so the theory is local and we don't run into the full difficulty of Floer theory.
Thus Rozansky-Witten theory is a categorified version of Fukaya theory that avoids the need for instanton corrections.

\subsection{An alternative viewpoint}

If $X = T^* W$ is a cotangent bundle, then $\ShvCat(W)$, the 2-category of (quasicoherent) sheaves of categories on $W$, embeds into $\RW_2$.
The image of this embedding consists of ``conic objects.''
Thus we can understand a key part of Rozansky-Witten theory, at least in this simple case.

The thesis (work in progress) of Enoch Yiu relates $\RW_2$ to $\ShvCat(W \times \AA^1)$.

\section{1/30 (Daigo Ito) -- Theory of Critical Points and Matrix Factorizations}

Recall that we wanted to understand the Rozansky-Witten theory of a holomorphic symplectic variety $M$.
By the cobordism hypothesis, it suffices to understand the 2-category $\RW_2(M)$.
We expect $\RW_2(M)$ to have some vague properties as follows.

The objects of $\RW_2$ should be holomorphic Lagrangians in $M$ (possibly equipped with extra data).
If $M = T^* L_1$, then we should have $\Hom_{\RW_2}(L_1, L_2) = \MF(L_1, f)$, the category of \emph{matrix factorizations} of $f$.
This measures the local geometry of $p \in L_1 \cap L_2 = \Crit(f)$.

Recall the two key differences between this and Lagrangian Floer homology:
\begin{itemize}
	\item There are no instantons, so the full subtleties of Floer theory don't appear.
	\item We are working at a higher category level.
\end{itemize}

Today we will recall the theory of critical points for a function $f: X \to \AA^1$.

\subsection{Milnor fibers}

Let's start by considering a regular map $f: \CC^n \to \CC$.
Assume that $0 \in \CC$ is a critical value.
Call $X_0 = f\inv(0)$ the special fiber -- this is typically singular.
For small $s \in \CC$, let $X_s = f\inv(s)$ be the nearby fiber.

\begin{thm}[Milnor]
	Let $x \in X_0$.
	For $\epsilon > 0$ sufficiently small, let $B(x, \epsilon)$ be the closed ball of radius $\epsilon$ centered at $x$, and let $S(x, \epsilon) = \partial B(x, \epsilon)$.
	Then:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $B(x, \epsilon) \cap X_0$ is homeomorphic to the cone over $K_x = S(x, \epsilon) \cap X_0$.
		\item The map $\rho_f = \frac{f}{\abs{f}} : S(x, \epsilon)  \setminus K_x \to S^1$ is a locally trivial fibration.
			We call $\rho_f$ the \emph{Milnor fibration} and the fiber $F_x$ the \emph{Milnor fiber}.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

The Milnor fibers $F_x$ degenerate to the cone over $K_x$.

\begin{ex}
	If $x$ is nonsingular, then $K_x$ is a sphere, so the cone over $K_x$ is a ball.
	The Milnor fibers $F_x$ are also balls.
\end{ex}

The topology of the Milnor fibers reflects ``how singular the point is'' -- a more singular point leads to a more complicated topology.

\begin{ex}
	Let $(X_0, x) = (z_1^2 - z_2^2 = 0, 0)$.
	Then $F_x$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^1$.
	Looking at real points, the map $f$ describes a family of hyperbolas degenerating to a union of lines.
	Here $\partial B = S^3$ and $K_x = S^1 \sqcup S^1$, so topologically $K_x$ is a double cone.
	The Milnor fibers form a family of cylinders degenerating to this double cone.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
	Let $(X_0, x) = (z_1^3 - z_2^2 = 0, 0)$.
	Then $K_x$ is a trefoil knot
	\[
		\bset{(r_1 e^{2\pi i t}, r_2 e^{2 \pi i t})}{t \in \RR} \subset S^1_{r_1} \times S^1_{r_2}.
	\]
	The closures of the Milnor fibers are genus one ``Seifert surfaces'' for $K_x$.
	Thus the Milnor fibers are homotopy equivalent to $S^1 \wedge S^1$.
\end{ex}

More generally, if $(X, x)$ is an isolated hypersurface singularity, then we can write $F_x \simeq (S^n)^{\vee \mu_x}$, where $\mu_x$ is the \emph{Milnor number}.\footnote{There is an explicit formula for the Milnor number, but we won't write it here.}
The $S^n$'s here are the \emph{vanishing cycles} of the singularity.

\subsection{Monodromy}

The singularity carries information beyond the Milnor fibers.
We can capture some of this by looking at the monodromy.

\begin{dfn}
	The \emph{monodromy} of $f$ at $x$ is the map $h_f: F_x \to F_x$ induced by circling around the base.
	This is a homeomorphism of $F_x$ which restricts to the identity on $\partial F_x$.
	Note that $h_f$ is only well-defined up to isotopy (fixing $\partial F_x$).
\end{dfn}

\begin{ex}
	For a Morse function $f = \sum_i x_i^2$, the Milnor fibers are homotopy equivalent to $S^n$.
	We understand the singularity by studying the monodromy of the Milnor fibers as we move around the singular point.
	This monodromy is a Dehn twist, ``corkscrewing'' the cylinder.
\end{ex}

\begin{thm}[Thom-Sebastiani]
	Let $f: (\CC^{n+1}, 0) \to (\CC, 0)$ and $g: (\CC^{m+1}, 0) \to (\CC, 0)$ be germs of hypersurface singularities.
	Define $f \boxplus g: (\CC^{n+1} \times \CC^{m+1}, 0) \to (\CC, 0)$ by $(f \boxplus g)(x, y) = f(x) + g(y)$.
	Then there is a homotopy-commutative diagram
	\[
		\begin{tikzcd}
			F_f * F_g \rar["\sim"] \dar["h_f * h_g"] & F_{f \boxplus g} \dar["h_{f \boxplus g}"] \\
			F_f * F_g \rar["\sim"] & F_{f \boxplus g},
		\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	where $*$ is the join of spaces.
\end{thm}

\subsection{Preview}

Next time we will introduce sheaves that describe the homology of these spaces.
We get a fiber sequence
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		i^*\Fc \rar & \psi_f \Fc \rar & \phi_f \Fc \rar & {}
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
of sheaves on $X_0$, where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $i: X_0 \to X$ is the inclusion,
	\item $\psi_f$ is nearby cycles, and
	\item $\phi_f$ is vanishing cycles.
\end{itemize}

This will categorify to a sequence
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\Perf(X_0) \rar & \Dsfb \Coh(X_0) \rar & \Dsing(X_0), & {} 
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
where $\Dsing(X_0)$ agrees with $\MF(X, f)$ in nice cases.
